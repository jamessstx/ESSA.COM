Infinite Vastness: Space is completely, mind-bogglingly vast. It is estimated to be around 93 billion light-years in diameter.

No Sound in Space: There is no atmosphere in space, which means there is no medium for sound to travel. In space, no one can hear you scream!

Black Holes: Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.

The Speed of Light: Light travels at a speed of about 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s) or about 186,282 miles per second. This is the fastest speed in the universe.

The Moon: Earth's only natural satellite, the Moon, is about 1/6th the size of Earth. It's the fifth largest moon in the solar system.

Solar System: Our solar system consists of eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Galaxies: The Milky Way, our galaxy, is estimated to contain 100 to 400 billion stars. There are billions of galaxies in the observable universe.

Exoplanets: Scientists have discovered thousands of exoplanets (planets orbiting other stars) using various methods, including the transit method and radial velocity method.

Big Bang Theory: The prevailing cosmological model suggests that the universe began with the Big Bang approximately 13.8 billion years ago. This theory explains the origin of the universe and its expansion.

Space Probes: Humans have sent various space probes to explore our solar system and beyond. Notable probes include Voyager 1 and 2, which have traveled beyond our solar system.

International Space Station (ISS): The ISS is a habitable artificial satellite that orbits Earth. It serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory where scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields.

Dark Matter and Dark Energy: About 85% of the mass of the universe is made up of dark matter, which doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light. Dark energy, making up about 68% of the universe, is a mysterious force responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe.

Asteroids and Meteoroids: Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the Sun, mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Meteoroids are smaller rocky or metallic objects in outer space. When they enter Earth's atmosphere, they are called meteors, and if they reach the ground, they are meteorites.

Life in Space: As of now, scientists have not discovered definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life, but the search for habitable environments and signs of life continues on Mars and other celestial bodies.

Space Agencies: NASA (United States), ESA (European Space Agency), Roscosmos (Russia), CNSA (China National Space Administration), and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) are some of the major space agencies involved in space exploration.
